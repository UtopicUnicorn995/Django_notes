URL Config/Routes: URL-action mappings which ensure that certain results are 'achieved' when certain URLs are entered by the user
URLS are responsible for defining the URLs we wanna support and the actions that should be triggered
Views are basically those actions
Views are all about holding the concrete logic
Views is just a function or Class

URLS files is defaultly created when creating a new project
(can add url file to it's application folder)

steps on creating urls and Views go to urls.py of application or main application
django.urls import path, include -> path is for the relative path -> include adds a new path and where it is located

from views.py
from django.http import HttpResponse, HttpResponseNotFound, HttpResponseRedirect
from django.urls import reverse

reverse() -> allows us to build urls dynamically -> identify them by (name)
